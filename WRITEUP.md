- in store pickup

###Collection & Pickup Points

#### Intro to Channel

This is a non-interactive channel made up of physical advertisements like the IKEA catalogue or billboards, or digital marketing like social media advertisements, youtube/TV ads.

#### Advertising

#### Philosophy & Design

focus on sustainability, drives word of mouth

amazing design philosophy allows for them to become a hosuehold name when looking to buy cheap, but good looking furniture

allowed them to turn a negative, tedious task, assembling furniture, into an experience as well, much like lego bricks

their focus on 'Rooms' (although changing) is a unique way to think about their products, and show how they fit together

naming their products with swedish names reinforces their culture, history, and also creates a recognizable product name distinct from other manufacturers

- when you hear an exotic non-English name of a furniture, you automatically think IKEA
